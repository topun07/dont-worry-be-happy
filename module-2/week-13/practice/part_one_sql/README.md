# Module Practice Assessment - SQL queries

## Introduction

This practice assessment verifies the competencies that you learned during the module. It's a hands-on assessment that you'll complete inside your choice of database clientâ€”such as pgAdmin or DbVisualizer.

This part of the hands-on assessment gives you four `SELECT` queries to write for the `BooksDB` database. You'll write the queries in the `.sql` files in the `queries` folder located in the same folder this `README` is in. Each file has a problem description of the query to write and the expected number of rows your query returns.

Also located in this directory is a Java project you can open in IntelliJ to verify your work. The Java project contains JUnit tests that are similar to the tests you ran for your SQL exercises earlier in the module.

You must make sure to save your changes to the SQL file before running the unit tests.

**After completing this part, you may `add`, `commit`, and `push` the code to your repository. Since this is a practice assessment, it's not graded and you don't need to submit this assessment to BootcampOS.**

## Hints and suggestions

* If you haven't done so already, create the `BooksDB` database. The script for the data is in this folder.
* The files are numbered in suggested order of completion, but you can do them in any order you wish.
* `push` your code often. Whenever you reach a point where you feel like you've made good progress, commit and push your changes.

## Running the tests

The project contains JUnit tests for you to verify your code. The tests are in `src/test/java/com.techelevator/AssessmentTests.java`. There's one test per query file.

> To run all tests in _IntelliJ_, you can right-click the `java` folder beneath `test`, and select **Run 'All Tests'**.
