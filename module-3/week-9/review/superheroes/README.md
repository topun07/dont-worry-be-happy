# Superheroes database

The purpose of this database is to practice using SQL to answer questions that might arise in a database. Please note that the ERD uses British  (colour), but the actual database uses American spelling (color).

## Getting started

1. Create a `Superheroes` database.
2. One by one in pgAdmin, open up and execute the `01_reference_data.sql` file, then the `02_hero_attributes.sql` file, and then the `03_hero_power.sql` file. These will load the tables with relevant data.
3. Finally, still in pgAdmin, open up the `queries.sql` file. You can use this to try the suggested queries and more of your own. I encourage you to save it after adding queries.
