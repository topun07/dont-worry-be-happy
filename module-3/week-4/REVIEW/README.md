# Week 3 Review Pair Exercise

## Context

It's common to receive a coding exercise or kata when interviewing for a software developer role. These problems may have strange edge cases, ambiguous instructions, or other quirks that can show your resourcefulness and how you work to solve a problem or intimidate and frustrate you. 

In this file's directory, you'll find an `exercises.js` file with nine problems of varying difficulty. Discuss and work through these problems with your partner and write a solution for each. Sometimes the most challenging part of a coding problem is explaining your answer to someone else, especially when it's your interviewer, so now is a great chance to practice doing so. 

You can find tests written for these problems in `tests.js`, and you can check your progress anytime by opening the `test.html` file in your preferred browser or with Live Server in VS Code. Although writing unit tests aren't a part of this exercise, thinking about testing and how you can confirm your code works can help you discover and tackle edge cases and find different ways to solve problems.

## Notes and tips

* With your partner, write functions to solve the problems described in `exercises.js`.
* You can check your work by viewing `test.html` in your preferred browser or using Live Server in VS Code.
* Take the time to practice talking through your solutions with each other.
* Think about how you would test your solutions, what potential edge cases could you encounter?
